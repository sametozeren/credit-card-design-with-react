# Credit Card Design with React

This project is my first project with react. Therefore, there may be errors. Card design is not responsive. 
This project was inspired by Tayfun Erbilen's ['Svelte ile Kredi Kartı Tasarımı'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1VJJ7xn5Ng) broadcast on [PROTOTURK](https://www.youtube.com/c/PROTOTURKCOM) channel. The same design was used. Don't forget to visit his channel for his efforts.

## Run the project

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

## Test the card type

Mastercard: `5168` <br/>
Visa: `4140`
